Node.js Notes 2



Node.js was made to handle networking the correct way, of course it is also a general purpose programming language.


----COMMAND LINE NOTE:
  Command line program 'ab' is the apache benchmark program to run a bunch of processes and benchmark the time it takes.
      ab -n 100 -c 100 http://127.0.0.1:3000/

  telnet or nc (netcat) to do tcp connections. i.e. nc localhost 3000
----END OF COMMAND LINE NOTE

process
  Process is the global object in node.js.
  Some examples: process.pid, process.env


Because node.js never waits for anything, it handles concurrency extremely well, it can pretty much always handle another connection. It performs much better with a lot of users than other web development technologies.
