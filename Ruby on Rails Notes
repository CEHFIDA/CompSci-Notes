Ruby on Rails Notes



Rails is a web framework for Ruby. Framework's are crazy. I don't like them.
Ruby is the language you use, but Rails sets up all sorts of stuff for you to get you
started on your website or web application.



************************ DESCRIPTION OF RAILS ************************


As a framework, Ruby on Rails (RoR) creates all sorts of files when you start a new project.
So until you're an expert in RoR I expect that it would just be really confusing, but I
guess that is the deal with frameworks. The upside is apparently once you understand and
are comfortable with a framework like Rails it is supposed to make it way easier and
quicker to make websites.

You're gonna want to build Rails applications using the command line.

Two guiding principles of the Rails philosophy is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and convention
over configuration (instead of having to specify things in configuration files, Rails standards
I guess are just followed by convention).

As a framework, you put all your code in Rails. Unlike when using say PHP, where you have HTML
files and CSS files and JS files and PHP files, everything in a Rails application goes in the
Rails framework.

Rails also uses eRuby, which is embedded Ruby. eRuby allows Ruby to be embedded within an HTML
file.

MVC:
    Rails is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. This means that it divides the work of
    the application up into three cooperating subsytems.



************************ STARUP / INSTALLATION ************************


Ideally what you do to get Ruby and Rails on your computer is to download the Ruby Version
Manager (RVM) and then use that to download the latest version of Ruby, gems (which I guess are
libraries or something, not sure), and Rails. The RVM keeps track of different version of Ruby
and Rails, and you can switch between versions in case you have websites running off older
version of Ruby and Rails. Gotta look online to figure out how to get all this done.

Once you've got Ruby and Rails (and possibly RVM) set up, along with a database on the command
line (Mac OS X comes with sqlite3 for example), you are ready to create a Rails application.

Rails Server:
    First you can check to make sure the Rails server is working. Make sure you are connected to
    the internet, and into the command line type:           rails server
    Then go to the browser and type in the URL:             localhost:3000
    This should show the Rails server welcome page. This is where your website will show up on
    localhost.
    To stop the web server just press Ctrl+c on the command line.

Create a new Rails application:
    To create a new Rails application on the command line simply type:      rails new project_name
                        i.e.        rails new helloworld
    You can see all the command line options that the Rails application builder accepts by running:
                        rails new -h
    After building your new application, move into its directory that Rails created. There is tons
    of stuff that Rails builds for you in the new application directory.




More needs to be added to this section.
