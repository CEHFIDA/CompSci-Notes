It makes a lot of things much easier.

************************ DEPLOYMENT ************************

Deploy to a Website:
  You can easily deploy your project to a website hosted by Meteor with the following command
  typed into the terminal in the project directory:
        meteor deploy appName.meteor.com

Android:
  To make your app run on android as a hybrid app type the following commands into the terminal
  in the project directory.
  
  Set up your project to be run on Android:
        meteor install-sdk android
        meteor add-platform android

  Run on Android Emulator:
        meteor run android

  Run on Android Device (plug your android device into your computer using USB):
        meteor run android-device
  Or instead if you want to point your android app to the server you deployed on the web (which
  you want to do because the above option just runs it on a local server, so once you end the
  server connection on the terminal the app on your device will no longer have access to the server):
        meteor run android-device --mobile-server appName.meteor.com

iOS:
  To make your app run on iOS (if you are using a Mac) as a hybrid app type the following commands
  in the terminal in the project directory:

  Set up your project to be run on iOS:
        meteor install-sdk ios
        meteor add-platform ios

  Run on iOS Emulator:
        meteor run ios

  Run on iOS device (if you have an Apple Developer Account):
        meteor run ios-device
  Or instead if you want to point your iOS app to the server you deployed on the web (which
  you want to do because the above option just runs it on a local server, so once you end the
  server connection on the terminal the app on your device will no longer have access to the server):
        meteor run ios-device --mobile-server appName.meteor.com

  iOS testing:
    To test on an emulator that isn't an iPhone 4 (which it opens in the emulator by default) you
    have to run "meteor run ios-device" on the command line (without an iOS device plugged into
    your Mac) which will open up Xcode. Then open up the iOS emulator from Xcode, pick the device
    you want, and run the app from Xcode.
