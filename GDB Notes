GDB (GNU Debugger)

Compile a C file
    gcc -g -o EXENAME source.c

To launch the debugger on a specific file or without specifying a file first:
    gdb EXENAME     or      gdb

Set up a breakpointat beginning of main function:
    break main          or          b main

Start program or restart it when already running it:
    run         or      r

Step through each line of code:
    next        or      n

Show source code (centered around current line):
    list        or      l
    i.e.    list 13         would show source code centered around line 13

Shows value of a specified variable:
    print VARIABLE      or      p VARIABLE

Set breakpoint at specific line:
    break LINENUMBER        or      b LINENUMBER
In case of using multiple files can also specify the file:
    b SOURCEFILE.C:LINENUMBER               i.e.    b helloworld.c:12

Go to the next breakpoint:
    continue        or      c

Set the value of a variable during runtime in debugger using print command:
    print VARIABLE = VALUE          or      p VARIABLE = VALUE

Print out all of the currently in-scope local variables:
    info locals

Disable all breakpoints previously made:
    disable

Exit GDB:
    quit        or      q
