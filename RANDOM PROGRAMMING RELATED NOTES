RANDOM PROGRAMMING RELATED NOTES

To make my profile see where an executable is located so I can use it from the command line
I don't need to make a symbolic link and put it in /usr/bin, instead I can just configure a
path variable by going to my .bash_profile file and typing in:
        export PATH="$PATH:absolute-path-to-exe"
Since I have macports I might need to add this line also to the file:
        .bash_profile.macports...etc.
And then running my .bash_profile by typing in this at the command line:
        source .bash_profile
Although you only need to run the .bash_profile once ever like this and then the terminal
will always run the bash profile when it is opened.
